PyPitches To Do
---------------

Web stuff
---------

- matplotlib generates HTML5 canvas now? How?

- compare to Dojo charting

- an interface to drive updating


Database stuff
--------------

- Record update events. Record raw files. Make permanent note of why some are rejected. Starting-off point for new update.

- Faster loading. Indexless temporary table?

- Table::
    
    downloads
        file text
        downloaded timestamp
        accepted boolean
        reject_reason integer foreign key references reject_reasons
                      -- or just enum?



Other
-----

- Semiauto updating.  web interface invokes Download.py -> load.py, no storing files inbetween. Machine knows what the last download and load were
